### Hello There! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alejandro Waiz, i am 23 years old and i've been programming on GoLang since 2020. My principal interest is back-end development but i'm getting
better with my front-end 'cause one of my dreams is to make a table-game of strategy, and finally with this programming-knowlegdment i can make it true! Nice!.

I'm currently getting better on my hexagonal architecture and improving the tools that i posses right now (Net/http, Gorilla/Mux, os) and its interesting discover
new pattern dessigns that can help me to make more escalable and flexible my applications.

On the other hand, i like a lot reading/studying stuff on the internet; talks, blogs, tutorials and any other thing that can help me with this. Also i like a lot mangas and comics of various genres, specially those about conspirations, mysteries or just good worlds with good stories. I also are addict to disco music; City pop, 70's and 80's disco music and 
relatives (Michael Jackson, George Benson, Earth wind and Fire, good stuff). Yeah, i think this will work as a intro to myself.
